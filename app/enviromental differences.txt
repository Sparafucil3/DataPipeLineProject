I found these differences between the Udacity virtual environment and my 
desktop/Google App Engine. This lead to some deployment woes. For instance, 
by default, the run.py attempts to import joblib from sklearn.externals. 
This method was deprecated some time ago. When I attempted to deploy, the
Google App Engine couldn't find this and the pickle file deployed from 
Udacity's virtual environment wouldn't work. I had to re-compile on my 
home computer and deploy that version. 

All of that is a lot of words to say "Udacity, I think it's time to 
upgrade your virtual environment."

Udacity's virtual environment: 
Python 3.6.3
ploty 2.0.15
nktk 3.2.5
sklearn 0.19.1
flask 0.12.5
pandas 0.23.3

Home desktop environment:
Python 3.8.8
plotly 4.14.3
nltk 3.5
sklearn 0.24.1
flask 1.1.2
pandas 1.2.3
